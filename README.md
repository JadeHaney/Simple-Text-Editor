# Simple Text Editor

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Text Editor project! This progressive web application (PWA) challenge aims to consolidate and demonstrate the skills you have acquired throughout the course. As a programmer, your goal is to create a single-page text editor application that runs seamlessly in the browser and meets PWA standards. The application will have robust data persistence mechanisms, ensuring that user data is preserved even if one storage method is not supported by the browser. Additionally, the application will be fully functional offline.

## User Story

### User Story
As a user, I want to be able to create, edit, and save text documents within my browser so that I can work on my notes or documents without needing a traditional word processor. I want the application to be reliable and able to function offline so that I can access my documents at any time, regardless of internet connectivity.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Application Launch and Usage:**
   - When the application is opened, it should load the last edited document if there is one.
   - The user should be able to start typing immediately in the text editor.
   - The application should provide a way to save the current document manually.
   - Changes should be saved automatically in real-time.

2. **Offline Functionality:**
   - The application should be fully functional without an internet connection.
   - Changes made offline should be saved and synced once the application is back online.

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Data should be stored using IndexedDB, providing redundancy with other techniques if needed.
   - The application should use the `idb` package for interacting with IndexedDB.
   - Stored data should be accessible even if the browser is closed and reopened.

4. **PWA Features:**
   - The application should be installable on the userâ€™s device.
   - The application should follow best practices for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
   - Service workers should be used to cache assets and enable offline functionality.

5. **Deployment:**
   - The application should be deployed using Render.
   - The deployment process should follow the Render Deployment Guide.

## Application Outline

### Project Structure

1. **Frontend:**
   - A single-page application built with React.
   - A simple and intuitive user interface for the text editor.
   - Real-time data binding for text input.

2. **Backend:**
   - Node.js/Express server to handle API requests.
   - RESTful API for CRUD operations on text documents.
   - Service workers for caching assets and offline support.

3. **Database:**
   - IndexedDB for storing text documents locally.
   - Use the `idb` package for a simplified API to interact with IndexedDB.

### Key Features

1. **Text Editor:**
   - A rich text editor built with a simple, user-friendly interface.
   - Support for basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline).

2. **Data Persistence:**
   - Real-time saving of text input to IndexedDB.
   - Automatic loading of the last edited document on application startup.
   - Manual save option for user control.

3. **Offline Support:**
   - Service workers to cache HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.
   - Offline fallback page in case the user accesses the app without an internet connection.

4. **PWA Compliance:**
   - Web manifest file to define the appâ€™s metadata and behavior.
   - Service workers to manage caching and offline functionality.
   - Installable on the userâ€™s device with an app-like experience.

You can create a `README.md` file in the root of your project and paste this content into it. Then, add, commit, and push this new file to your repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README file with project details"
git push origin main
This will ensure that your repository includes a comprehensive README file outlining the project details, user story, and application structure.
